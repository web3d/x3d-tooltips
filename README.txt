How to contribute new tooltips in another language:
a. Contributing authors need to first volunteer in order for change files to get set up properly.
b. Each tooltip file is an XML file with common structure, named X3dTooltips_LanguageName_.html.
   Build tools process each .xml source file to produce a corresponding .html tooltip page.
c. Contributors replace English-language tooltips with equivalent phrases in the other language.
   Do NOT change any of the XML data structures or X3D element/attribute/type names.
   Often it is much easier for contributors to use a keyboard matching their language.
d. Build tools process each .xml source file to produce a corresponding .html tooltip page.
   Be careful not to break the XML data structures, the tooltips.xml should always validate.
e. All source and tools are maintained in SourceForge version control for easy reliability.
   You can send updates to me and I will integrate.  If appropriate, we will grant you permissions. 
f. First make and send a small change to ensure that Internationalization (I18N) issues are OK.
   If you also want to provide translations of the top header paragraph, that will be great.
   Header changes are integrated into the tooltip stylesheet which converts .xml into .html.
g. Many of the English tooltip phrases are duplicated, so search + replace simplifies editing.
h. Authors can use Ant build.xml support which provides helpful tasks for tooltip production.
i. Submitted tooltip updates are verified, validated and tested before online publication.
j. The most-accurate tooltips are found in the latest English version: x3d-3.3.profile.xml

Recommendation:  make a very small change first and let us together test that the process working.

Questions, suggestions, bug reports and contributions are always welcome, thanks for all efforts.
Have fun with X3D!
